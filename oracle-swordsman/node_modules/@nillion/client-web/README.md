# Javascript Nillion Client

:warning: **DEPRECATION NOTICE**: _This package is deprecated and is scheduled for deletion in late
September 2024. Please see [nillion-ts](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-ts) for its
replacement._

This javascript package provides programmatic access to the Nillion network, directly from the browser, using
a wrapped WASM package that, in addition to implementing Nillion algorithms, it connects directly to the libP2P
network using secure websockets. Consider that this library also makes use of browser web-workers.

Be advised that this will cause the browser to enforce certain CORS rules that can be allowed by
setting the following server headers:

- Header: 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy'
  Value: 'require-corp'
- Header: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy'
  Value: 'same-origin'
